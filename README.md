### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/real-estate-website.git
   cd real-estate-website/server.js
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## How the System Works
1. Users sign up or log in to access the platform.
2. Property owners can list new properties by providing details and images.
3. Buyers or renters can browse listings, filter results, and contact property owners.
4. Admins have access to manage users, properties, and site content.

## Principle Behind the Project
This real estate platform operates on the principles of **web development, database management, and user experience optimization:**
- **Full-Stack Development:** Combining frontend UI/UX with a secure backend.
- **Database Management:** Storing and retrieving property details efficiently.
- **Search & Filters:** Allowing users to find properties that match their preferences.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle multiple users and property listings.

## Running the Project
Once both frontend and backend servers are running, open your browser and navigate to:
```bash
http://localhost:3019
```
This will load the homepage where users can start browsing real estate listings.
